# precision-weather

## Precision weather, is a weather dashboard that allows you to select your city of choice and gives you todays forecast along with a 5 day forecast. The forecast includes temperature, wind and humidity.

## The purpose of this project was to create a simple weather forecast using a front end server side API to pull the weather data based on the city the user is searching for.

## Precision weather solves the problems of going to a fully built website when a user only wants minimal data. Fully developed websites typically have longer load times with loads of ads and data or features that some users may not need at the moment.

## Through the development of precision weather, I learned the importance of using the console in the browser to make sure the intended data we are trying to fetch is being retrieved from the API and diagnose any errors.
